# Presentation Editor (preditor)
A convenient editor for making presentations in plain-text
(Markdown, HTML).

The goal is to generate presentations which can be used by multiple
"engines", including [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark),
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js),
[cleaver](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver), and more.
